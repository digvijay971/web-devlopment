        Shadowboxing is a combat sport exercise in which a person throws punches at the air as though there is an opponent.
        Practised primarily in boxing, it is used mainly to prepare the muscles before the person training engages in stronger
        physical activity.</p>
        <p class="example2">The basic boxing stance is supposed to be easy for beginners to attack and defend easily. You're well covered in this
