            The stock market is a financial marketplace where buyers and sellers trade ownership stakes  in public
            companies, known as stocks. Companies raise capital by issuing these shares, while investors buy them to potentially
            profit from price increases  or dividends, which are payments of a company's profits. Trading occurs on
            stock exchanges, which act as regulated platforms that facilitate these transactions, with prices determined by the
            forces of supply and demand.
